## Boxing Gym Website - React 

This website is my first attempt at creating a fully functional website using React. 
I chose to build a website for a brand new boxing gym because I enjoy the sport and it was fun to design. 
## Project Overview
This website is built using React + Vite and organised into modular components to keep clean code. Itâ€™s designed to provide a smooth user experience and navigation across all pages.

## Deployment 
The project is deployed on Vercel and available to visit [here!](https://boxing-gym-react.vercel.app/)

*As this is my first project, it is currently only optimised for medium/large devices, in the process of updating for smaller devices*
